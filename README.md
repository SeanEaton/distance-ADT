# distance-ADT
An ADT for creating and operating on empirical distance measurements (feet &amp; inches)

This is a project created for school, where the user can create a Distance object, which takes in two parameters, and smartly converts these into a sensible feet & inches measurement.
The program overloads all important operators for performing calculations with these measurements (addition, multiplication, comparison, etc.)
